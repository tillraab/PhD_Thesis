  Abstract                 = {South American weakly electric fish produce a variety of electric organ discharge (EOD) amplitude and frequency modulations including chirps or rapid increases in EOD frequency that function as agonistic and courtship and mating displays. In Apteronotus leptorhynchus, chirps are readily evoked by the presence of the EOD of a conspecific or a sinusoidal signal designed to mimic another EOD, and we found that the frequency difference between the discharge of a given animal and that of an EOD mimic is important in determining which of two categories of chirp an animal will produce. Type-I chirps (EOD frequency increases averaging 650Hz and lasting approximately 25ms) are preferentially produced by males in response to EOD mimics with a frequency of 50{\textendash}200Hz higher or lower than that of their own. The EOD frequency of Apteronotus leptorhynchus is sexually dimorphic: female EODs range from 600 to 800Hz and male EODs range from 800 to 1000Hz. Hence, EOD frequency differences effective in evoking type-I chirps are most likely to occur during male/female interactions. This result supports previous observations that type-I chirps are emitted most often during courtship and mating. Type-II chirps, which consist of shorter-duration frequency increases of approximately 100Hz, occur preferentially in response to EOD mimics that differ from the EOD of the animal by 10{\textendash}15Hz. Hence these are preferentially evoked when animals of the same sex interact and, as previously suggested, probably represent agonistic displays. Females typically produced only type-II chirps. We also investigated the effects of arginine vasotocin on chirping. This peptide is known to modulate communication and other types of behavior in many species, and we found that arginine vasotocin decreased the production of type-II chirps by males and also increased the production of type-I chirps in a subset of males. The chirping of most females was not significantly affected by arginine vasotocin.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The evolution of cooperation requires benefits of group living to exceed costs. Hence, some components of fitness are expected to increase with increasing group size, whereas others may decrease because of competition among group members. The social spiders provide an excellent system to investigate the costs and benefits of group living: they occur in groups of various sizes and individuals are relatively short-lived, therefore life history traits and Lifetime Reproductive Success (LRS) can be estimated as a function of group size. Sociality in spiders has originated repeatedly in phylogenetically distant families and appears to be accompanied by a transition to a system of continuous intra-colony mating and extreme inbreeding. The benefits of group living in such systems should therefore be substantial. We investigated the effect of group size on fitness components of reproduction and survival in the social spider Stegodyphus dumicola in two populations in Namibia. In both populations, the major benefit of group living was improved survival of colonies and late-instar juveniles with increasing colony size. By contrast, female fecundity, female body size and early juvenile survival decreased with increasing group size. Mean individual fitness, estimated as LRS and calculated from five components of reproduction and survival, was maximized for intermediate- to large-sized colonies. Group living in these spiders thus entails a net reproductive cost, presumably because of an increase in intra-colony competition with group size. This cost is traded off against survival benefits at the colony level, which appear to be the major factor favouring group living. In the field, many colonies occur at smaller size than expected from the fitness curve, suggesting ecological or life history constraints on colony persistence which results in a transient population of relatively small colonies.},

  Abstract                 = {The study of physiological stress and its context in free-ranging animals provides a means for understanding the challenges found in the natural habitat. Patterns of physiological stress in free-ranging animals have yet to be well characterized. Methodological difficulties in measuring physiological responses in the natural habitat have limited this area of research. In this research, physiological stress in free-ranging ring-tailed lemurs,Lemur catta, was estimated using a steroid-extraction method to measure cortisol levels from female faeces. Ten females were observed across two social groups in southwestern Madagascar during a 5-month period including portions of the annual wet and dry seasons. I used behavioural measures to estimate predation threat, food accessibility and individual dominance status, to determine whether these variables predict faecal cortisol levels. Faecal cortisol levels were relatively high during two distinct periods: one period coincided with late gestation and the other period corresponded with the end of the dry season, when high-intensity antipredatory behaviour and estimates of feeding effort were elevated. In addition, faecal cortisol measures were significantly correlated with dominance indices: high-index individuals had high cortisol values, and low-index individuals had low cortisol values. These results suggest that faecal cortisol measures can be used to assess seasonal and individual differences in adrenal activity in this lemurid primate, and that this measure could provide a means for quantifying physiological stress in free-ranging animals.},

Up to 6% of rutting stags are permanently injured each year, while fighting success and reproductive success are closely related, within age groups as well as across them. Fighting behaviour is sensitive to changes in the potential benefits of fighting: stags fight most frequently and most intensely where potential benefits are high and tend to avoid fighting with individuals they are unlikely to beat. The relevance of these findings to theoretical models of fighting behaviour is discussed.},

In many cases they preferentially rely on electrosensory cues. Do fish also memorize non-electrosensory cues? Here, we trained individuals of gymnotiform weakly electric fish Apteronotus albifrons in an object discrimination task. Objects were combinations of differently conductive materials covered with differently colored cotton hoods. By setting visual and electrosensory cues in conflict we analyzed the sensory hierarchy among the electrosensory and the visual sense in object discrimination. Our experiments show that: (i) black ghost knifefish can be trained to solve discrimination tasks similarly to the mormyrid fish; (ii) fish preferentially rely on electrosensory cues for object discrimination; (iii) despite the dominance of the electrosense they still learn the visual cue and use it when electrosensory information is not available; (iv) fish prefer the trained combination of rewarded cues over combinations that match only in a single feature and also memorize the non-rewarded combination.},

  Abstract                 = {Gymnotiform fish use their electric organ discharge for electrolocation and communication. They are active nocturnally and seek retreat sites during the day. We examined retreat site selection in Apteronotus leptorhynchus by assessing their preference for retreat tubes that differed in opacity and dimension. Isolated fish preferred opaque to clear tubes, long and narrow diameter tubes to short, wide diameter tubes, and open-ended to closed tubes. We also assessed how groups of fish distributed themselves in tubes according to sex and electric organ discharge frequency under four conditions: (1) unlimited tube availability, (2) limited tube availability, (3) variation in tube opacity, and (4) variation in tube dimension. When tube availability was unlimited, fish generally preferred to occupy tubes alone. However, females, but not males, often cohabited tubes with consexuals. When tube availability was limited, females were more often than males found outside of tubes. When tubes varied by opacity and dimension, fish clustered most commonly in preferred tube types (opaque and long tubes). Males with the highest electric organ discharge frequencies usually occupied the most preferred tube type. Thus, fish have clear preferences in selecting retreat sites and groups of fish reveal their dominance relationships when presented with variation in retreat sites.},

  Abstract                 = {Dominance hierarchies are ubiquitous in social species and serve to organize social systems. Social and sexual status is communicated directly among animals via sensory systems evolved in the particular species. Such signals may be chemical, visual, auditory, postural or a combination of signals. In most species, status is initially established through physical conflict between individuals that leads to ritualized conflict or threats, reducing possibly dangerous results of fighting. Many of the status signals contain other information, as in some bird species that communicate both the size of their group and their individual rank vocally. Recent studies have shown that scent signaling among hyenas of east Africa is unique, being produced by fermentative, odor producing bacteria residing in the scent glands.},

  Abstract                 = {Field studies on freely behaving animals commonly require tagging and often are focused on single species. Weakly electric fish generate a species- and individual-specific electric organ discharge (EOD) and therefore provide a unique opportunity for individual tracking without tagging. Here, we present and test tracking algorithms based on recordings with submerged electrode arrays. Harmonic structures extracted from power spectra provide fish identity. Localization of fish based on weighted averages of their EOD amplitudes is found to be more robust than fitting a dipole model. We apply these techniques to monitor a community of three species, Apteronotus rostratus, Eigenmannia humboldtii and Sternopygus dariensis, in their natural habitat in Dari{\'e}n, Panama. We found consistent upstream movements after sunset followed by downstream movements in the second half of the night. Extrapolations of these movements and estimates of fish density obtained from additional transect data suggest that some fish cover at least several hundreds of meters of the stream per night. Most fish, including E. humboldtii, were traversing the electrode array solitarily. From in situ measurements of the decay of the EOD amplitude with distance of individual animals, we estimated that fish can detect conspecifics at distances of up to 2 m. Our recordings also emphasize the complexity of natural electrosensory scenes resulting from the interactions of the EODs of different species. Electrode arrays thus provide an unprecedented window into the so-far hidden nocturnal activities of multispecies communities of weakly electric fish at an unmatched level of detail.},

  Abstract                 = {The impact of aggresive competition on food intake at all the resources used is analysed for every member of a group of brown capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) in the Manu National Park, Peru, where they live in groups of 8--14 animals. An individual's food intake at a given tree was affected independently both by its domirance rank (Fig. 1) and by how much aggression it received (Table 5). Food intake was not strongly affected by body size when dominance rank was held constant by partial correlation. At food sources where high rates of fighting occurred, an individual's food intake depended more on its domirance status than on the rate of aggression it received (Fig. 2). However, food intake at resources where rates of fighting were low depended mostly on the rate of aggression received. When aggression over food was absent, the food intakes of dominants and subordinates were equal. Dominants had significantly greater total energy intake (20.5{\%} more) than did subordinates, even though more than one third of their diet came from food sources where little or no fighting occurred (Fig. 3). Energy intake was also significantly greater for individuals that received little aggression. The only adult that emigrated from the main study group was the individua with the lowest energy intake. Competition for food within groups was more than ten times as intense as competition between brown capuchin groups.},

  Abstract                 = {Individuals in a foraging group of brown capuchin monkeys choose different spatial positions relative to the rest of the group. An individual's choice of spatial positiion affects its foraging success and perceived predation risk (as measured by vigilance behaviour). The two most dominant group members preferred to forage where their expected forwaging success was greatest. Juveniles chose to forage where their perceived predation risk was least, not where they would achieve the highest foraging success. The positions used by non-dominant adults neither maximized foraging success nor minimized predation risk. It is likely that subordinate adults accept spatial positions with suboptimal ecological consequences to avoid the costs of frequent confrontations with the dominant members of the group over foraging sites in poreferred positions.},

  Abstract                 = {An animal can only survive in a given habitat if it has enough time to find, process and digest food whilst avoiding predation. The time it has for food acquisition is affected by the vegetation and competition with conspecifics, which depends on aggregation tendencies. We used the relationships between time allocations, on the one hand, and climatic variables (as a proxy for habitat quality) and group size, on the other, to develop a model that predicts maximum ecologically tolerable group size at different locations for spider monkeys. Spider monkeys are particularly interesting because the social communities often split up into small units. Temperature variation and rainfall variation were the main determinants of time budgets. Community size and average annual rainfall determined party size. The model correctly predicted presence or absence of spider monkeys at 78--83{\%} of 217 New World forest sites. Within the geographical range of the species, this time budget model predicted the presence of spider monkeys better than a model based directly on climate variables. Predicted community and party sizes were significantly larger at sites where spider monkeys are present than at sites where they are absent. As required by the model, predicted maximum community sizes were significantly larger than observed community sizes. Moving time showed a U-shaped relationship with party size, which suggests that moving time is the factor that keeps spider monkey communities from travelling together in a tight group.},

  Abstract                 = {1.The gymnotid, Gymnorhamphichthys hypostomus, (sandfish) exhibits in nature well marked activity cycles which are accompanied by substantial changes in the frequency of discharges from its electric organ.2.During the day the sandfish is buried in the sand and the discharge frequency is low (10 to 15/sec): at night the fish is freely swimming and the frequency is high (65 to 100/sec).3.The sharp rise in discharge frequency, which occurs when the fish emerges from the sand, provides a useful reference point in determining the phase of the rhythm. This sharp rise is preceded by a slight and very gradual pre-emergence rise in frequency.4.The periodicity of frequency changes persists in continuous dim light with a period which is often significantly different from exactly 24 hours and must therefore be considered an endogenous rhythm.5.Light appears to be the effective entraining agent.6.The basic discharge rate of the undisturbed fish appears to be determined by the endogenous rhythm, but the frequency at any one time can be markedly affected by external stimuli. The endogenous rhythm can overrule the indirect inhibitory effects of a light stimulus.7.Light per se has little or no direct influence on the discharge rate; e.g. the fish continues to be active and to discharge at high frequency for prolonged periods in the presence of light if no sand is available.},

  Abstract                 = {What are the costs and benefits for animals living in groups of different sizes? Balancing the trade-offs between within-group competition (which favors smaller groups) and between-group competition (which favors larger groups) suggests that intermediate-sized groups may be best, yet empirical support for this prediction has largely been lacking. Using long-term data on wild baboons, we provide novel evidence that individuals living in intermediate-sized groups have energetically optimal space-use strategies and lower glucocorticoid (stress hormone) concentrations than individuals in either large or small groups. Our results offer new insight into the costs and benefits of group living.Group size is an important trait of social animals, affecting how individuals allocate time and use space, and influencing both an individual{\textquoteright}s fitness and the collective, cooperative behaviors of the group as a whole. Here we tested predictions motivated by the ecological constraints model of group size, examining the effects of group size on ranging patterns and adult female glucocorticoid (stress hormone) concentrations in five social groups of wild baboons (Papio cynocephalus) over an 11-y period. Strikingly, we found evidence that intermediate-sized groups have energetically optimal space-use strategies; both large and small groups experience ranging disadvantages, in contrast to the commonly reported positive linear relationship between group size and home range area and daily travel distance, which depict a disadvantage only in large groups. Specifically, we observed a U-shaped relationship between group size and home range area, average daily distance traveled, evenness of space use within the home range, and glucocorticoid concentrations. We propose that a likely explanation for these U-shaped patterns is that large, socially dominant groups are constrained by within-group competition, whereas small, socially subordinate groups are constrained by between-group competition and predation pressures. Overall, our results provide testable hypotheses for evaluating group-size constraints in other group-living species, in which the costs of intra- and intergroup competition vary as a function of group size.},

  Abstract                 = {By using harmonic radar, we report the complete flight paths of displaced bees. Test bees forage at a feeder or are recruited by a waggle dance indicating the feeder. The flights are recorded after the bees are captured when leaving the hive or the feeder and are released at an unexpected release site. A sequence of behavioral routines become apparent: (i) initial straight flights in which they fly the course that they were on when captured (foraging bees) or that they learned during dance communication (recruited bees); (ii) slow search flights with frequent changes of direction in which they attempt to {\textquotedblleft}get their bearings{\textquotedblright}; and (iii) straight and rapid flights directed either to the hive or first to the feeding station and then to the hive. These straight homing flights start at locations all around the hive and at distances far out of the visual catchment area around the hive or the feeding station. Two essential criteria of a map-like spatial memory are met by these results: bees can set course at any arbitrary location in their familiar area, and they can choose between at least two goals. This finding suggests a rich, map-like organization of spatial memory in navigating honey bees.},

  Abstract                 = {Plasticity in the frequency of the electric organ discharge (EOD) and electroreceptor tuning of weakly electric fish was studied in the genusApteronotus. Both hormone-induced and maturational changes in EOD frequency and electroreceptor tuning were examined.Apteronotus is different from all other steroid-responsive weakly electric fish in that estradiol-17$\beta$, rather than androgens, induces discharge frequency decreases. This result can account for the `reversed' discharge frequency dimorphism found inApteronotus in which, counter to all other known sexually dimorphic electric fish, females have lower discharge frequencies than males. Studies of electroreceptor tuning inApteronotus indicate that electroreceptors are closely tuned to the frequency of the EOD. This finding was noted not only in adult animals, but also in juvenile animals shortly after the onset of their EODs. Tuning plasticity inApteronotus, as in other species studied, is associated with altered EOD frequencies and was noted in both maturational EOD changes and in estrogen-induced changes. Thus, tuning plasticity appears to be a general phenomenon which occurs concurrent with a variety of EOD changes.},

  Abstract                 = {Sensory systems are faced with the task of extracting behaviorally relevant information from complex sensory environments. In general, sensory acquisition involves two aspects: the control of peripheral sensory surfaces to improve signal reception and the subsequent neural filtering of incoming sensory signals to extract and enhance signals of interest. The electrosensory system of weakly electric fish provides a good model system for studying both these aspects of sensory acquisition. On the basis of infrared video recordings of black ghost knifefish (Apteronotus albifrons) feeding on small prey (Daphnia magna) in the dark, we reconstruct three-dimensional movement trajectories of the fish and prey. We combine the reconstructed trajectory information with models of peripheral electric image formation and primary electrosensory afferent response dynamics to estimate the spatiotemporal patterns of transdermal potential change and afferent activation that occur during prey-capture behavior. We characterize the behavioral strategies used by the fish, with emphasis on the functional importance of the dorsal edge in prey capture behavior, and we analyze the electrosensory consequences. In particular, we find that the high-pass filter characteristics of P-type afferent response dynamics can serve as a predictive filter for estimating the future position of the prey as the electrosensory image moves across the receptor array.},

  Abstract                 = {The view is examined that the adaptive value of conventional aspects of fighting behaviour is for assessment of relative RHP (resource holding power) of the combatants. Outcomes of aggressive disputes should be decided by each individual's fitness budget available for expenditure during a fight (determined by the fitness difference between adoption of alternative strategies, escalation or withdrawal without escalation) and on the rate of expenditure of the fitness budget if escalation occurs (determined by the RHPs of the combatants). Thus response thresholds for alternative strategies (“assessments”) will be determined by natural selection on a basis of which opponent is likely to expend its fitness budget first, should escalation occur. This “loser” should retreat (before escalation) and the winner should stay in possession of the resource. Many aggressive decisions depend on whether one is a resource holder, or an attacker. Assuming the RHP of the combatants to be equal, there are many instances of fitness pay-off imbalances between holder and attacker which should weight the dispute outcome in favour of one or other opponent by allowing it a greater expendable fitness budget. Usually the weighting favours the holder; the attacker therefore needs a correspondingly higher RHP before it may be expected to win. This is not invariably the case, and much observed data fits the predictions of this sort of model. If assessments are perfect and budget expenditure rates exactly predictable, then there would never seem to be any case for escalation. Escalation can be explained in terms of injury inflictions (expenditures) occurring as discrete events; i.e. as “bouts” won or lost during fighting. Assessment can give only a probabilistic prediction of the outcome of a bout. A simple model is developed to investigate escalation situations. Each combatant assesses relative RHP; this correlates with an absolute probability of winning the next bout (cabs). The stake played for is infliction of loss of RHP and is determined by the fitness budgets of the opponents. (Each individual plays for the withdrawal of its opponent.) This defines a critical probability of winning (ccrit) for each combatant, above which escalation is the favourable strategy (cabs > ccrit) and below which withdrawal is favourable (cabs < ccrit). Escalation should occur only where cabs-ccrit is positive for both combatants. This model gives predictions compatible with the observations, indicating that RHP loss alone can be adequate to explain withdrawal: escalation behaviour. Withdrawal tendency will be increased by low searching costs. Escalations should be restricted to closely matched RHP opponents if RHP disparity is the major imbalance. Outside the “escalation range” of a given individual, the higher RHP individual wins and the lower one loses (i.e. it should withdraw after conventional display). RHP disparity and holder: attacker imbalance should both interact to shape the observed pattern, though their relative importances will depend on species and situation. In some instances selection may favour immediate withdrawal from an occupied territory even without assessment of RHP.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the most striking patterns in biology is the formation of animal aggregations. Classically, aggregation has been viewed as an evolutionarily advantageous state, in which members derive the benefits of protection, mate choice, and centralized information, balanced by the costs of limiting resources. Consisting of individual members, aggregations nevertheless function as an integrated whole, displaying a complex set of behaviors not possible at the level of the individual organism. Complexity theory indicates that large populations of units can self-organize into aggregations that generate pattern, store information, and engage in collective decision-making. This begs the question, are all emergent properties of animal aggregations functional or are some simply pattern? Solutions to this dilemma will necessitate a closer marriage of theoretical and modeling studies linked to empirical work addressing the choices, and trajectories, of individuals constrained by membership in the group.},

  Abstract                 = {Electrocommunication and -localization behaviors of weakly electric fish have been studied extensively in the lab, mostly by means of short-term observations on constrained fish. Far less is known about their behaviors in more natural-like settings, where fish are less constrained in space and time. We tracked individual fish in a population of fourteen brown ghost knifefish (Apteronotus leptorhynchus) housed in a large 2 m<sup>3</sup> indoor tank based on their electric organ discharges (EOD). The tank contained four different natural-like microhabitats (gravel, plants, isolated stones, stacked stones). In particular during the day individual fish showed preferences for specific habitats which provided appropriate shelter. Male fish with higher EOD frequencies spent more time in their preferred habitat during the day, moved more often between habitats during the night, and less often during the day in comparison to low-frequency males. Our data thus revealed a link between dominance indicated by higher EOD frequency, territoriality, and a more explorative personality in male A. leptorhynchus. In females, movement activity during both day and night correlated positively with EOD frequency. In the night, fish of either sex moved to another habitat after about 6 s on average. During the day, the average transition time was also very short at about 20 s. However, these activity phases were interrupted by phases of inactivity that lasted on average about 20 min during the day, but only 3 min in the night. The individual preference for daytime retreat sites did not reflect the frequent explorative movements at night.},

  Abstract                 = {The present paper highlights the relationship between social status and production of gradual frequency rises in interacting Apteronotus albifrons. The gradual frequency rise production was mathematically inferred and a discrete classification deliberately avoided. The results showed little gradual frequency rise production before the hierarchy settlement. Afterwards, only the dominant fish kept this gradual frequency rise production at low levels, while the subdominant fish drastically increased it in all following interaction contexts. The hypothesis of gradual frequency rises being involved in communication as submissive signals was thus strengthened.},

  abstract = {Extracting complementary features in parallel pathways is a widely used strategy for a robust representation of sensory signals. Weakly electric fish offer the rare opportunity to study complementary encoding of social signals in all of its electrosensory pathways. Electrosensory information is conveyed in three parallel pathways: two receptor types of the tuberous (active) system and one receptor type of the ampullary (passive) system. Modulations of the fish's own electric field are sensed by these receptors and used in navigation, prey detection, and communication. We studied the neuronal representation of electric communication signals (called chirps) in the ampullary and the two tuberous pathways of Eigenmannia virescens. We first characterized different kinds of chirps observed in behavioral experiments. Since Eigenmannia chirps simultaneously drive all three types of receptors, we studied their responses in in vivo electrophysiological recordings. Our results demonstrate that different electroreceptor types encode different aspects of the stimuli and each appears best suited to convey information about a certain chirp type. A decoding analysis of single neurons and small populations shows that this specialization leads to a complementary representation of information in the tuberous and ampullary receptors. This suggests that a potential readout mechanism should combine information provided by the parallel processing streams to improve chirp detectability.},

  Abstract                 = {How do groups of animals, including humans, make decisions that affect the entire group? Evidence collected from schooling animals suggests that the process is somewhat democratic, with nearest neighbors and the majority shaping overall collective behavior. In animals with hierarchical social structures such as primates or wolves, however, such democracy may be complicated by dominance. Strandburg-Peshkin et al. monitored all the individuals within a baboon troop continuously over the course of their daily activities. Even within this highly socially structured species, movement decisions emerged via a shared process. Thus, democracy may be an inherent trait of collective behavior.Science, this issue p. 1358Conflicts of interest about where to go and what to do are a primary challenge of group living. However, it remains unclear how consensus is achieved in stable groups with stratified social relationships. Tracking wild baboons with a high-resolution global positioning system and analyzing their movements relative to one another reveals that a process of shared decision-making governs baboon movement. Rather than preferentially following dominant individuals, baboons are more likely to follow when multiple initiators agree. When conflicts arise over the direction of movement, baboons choose one direction over the other when the angle between them is large, but they compromise if it is not. These results are consistent with models of collective motion, suggesting that democratic collective action emerging from simple rules is widespread, even in complex, socially stratified societies.},

  Abstract                 = {Home range size, range use and range overlap of adult male and female red squirrels in a coniferous and a deciduous woodland were studied using radio-telemetry. Hypotheses, concerning (1) resource predictability and territorial behaviour, and (2) sex-related and habitat-related differences in spacing strategies were tested. In both habitats males had larger home ranges than females. Range size varied seasonally, tending to increase in April–June and to decrease in winter. Both males and females had intensively used core-areas (70% of all locations) that were much smaller than their total range. Dominant males had larger ranges than subordinates, and male body weight was positively correlated with home range size. For females, range size was inversely correlated with food abundance (coniferous area) or local density (deciduous area). Core-area overlap within a sex was smaller than that between sexes. Dominant females defended exlusive core-area overlap within a sex was smaller than that between sexes. Dominant females defended exclusive core-areas against other females, while subordinates behaved as floaters or settled on the edges of the ranges of dominant females. In the deciduous woodland squirrels had larger home ranges, used significantly larger and more strongly overlapping core-areas and were more tolerant of conspecifics than in the coniferous woodland. The results support the hypotheses that (1) the predictability in time and space of food resources, and (2) sexual differences in key resources used to increase reproductive success in mammals with promiscuous or polygynous mating systems, cause differences in spacing behaviour between habitat types and between adult males and females.},

  Abstract                 = {1. A survey of the species distribution, discharge characteristics, ecology and behaviour of South American Gymnotiforme electric fish was carried out during two field trips to sites in the vicinity of Kourou, French Guiana, in 1983 and 1985. 2. Measurements of water conditions, collected over a twelve month period, highlight the strong ecological pressure on species exploiting the rapidly fluctuating and often temporary coastal streams. Adaptation of the reproductive cycle to the rainy seasons is particularly marked and the possible zeitgebers are considered. Given the almost invariant water conductivity, its suggested use as an environmental trigger is rejected in favour of acoustic or mechanical cues. 3. The two main study areas were inhabited principally by pulse gymnotoids of the genera Gymnotus and Hypopomus. A new Hypopomus species was discovered as well as specimens of G. pantherinus, previously undescribed in French Guiana. Larvae of H. beevei were found prior to the start of the 1985 rainy season. Developmental data for this species are presented which support the view that, as in other weakly electric gymnotoids, a primitive larval electric organ probably precedes the adult structure. The larval discharge also strongly resembles that of the adult electric eel, lending weight to published theories of an Electrophorus-like ancestor to the wekly electric fish. 4. The predatory behaviour of the strongly electric eel was recorded in detail. The field results indicated that this species preyed on weakly electric fish whose responses to the foraging eel are also reported. The probable use of electrical cues by hunting eels was further investigated in a laboratory experiment in which predatory responses were compared in the presence of non-electric and electric live prey, and models mimicking electric prey. It is concluded that electrical cues are probably of paramount importance in the eel's normal prey capture behaviour.},

  Abstract                 = {To evolve and to be maintained, seasonal migration, despite its risks, has to yield fitness benefits compared with year-round residency. Empirical data supporting this prediction have remained elusive in the bird literature. To test fitness related benefits of migration, we studied a partial migratory population of European blackbirds (\textit{Turdus merula}) over 7 years. Using a combination of capture-mark-recapture and radio telemetry, we compared survival probabilities between migrants and residents estimated by multi-event survival models, showing that migrant blackbirds had 16\% higher probability to survive the winter compared to residents. A subsequent modelling exercise revealed that residents should have 61.25\% higher breeding success than migrants, to outweigh the survival costs of residency. Our results support theoretical models that migration should confer survival benefits to evolve, and thus provide empirical evidence to understand the evolution and maintenance of migration.},

  Abstract                 = {In this study, we focused on the seasonal variation of the determinants of territory size in the weakly electric fish Gymnotus omarorum. This species is a seasonal breeder that displays year-round territorial aggression. Female and male dyads exhibit indistinguishable non-breeding territorial agonistic behavior and body size is the only significant predictor of contest outcome. We conducted field surveys across seasons that included the identification of individual location, measurements of water physico-chemical variables, characterization of individual morphometric and physiological traits, and their correlation to spatial distribution. G. omarorum tolerates a wide range of dissolved oxygen concentration, and territory size correlated positively with dissolved oxygen in both seasons. In the non-breeding season, territory size was sexually monomorphic and correlated only with body size. In the breeding season, territory size no longer correlated with body size but differed between sexes: (i) the overall spatial arrangement was sexually biased, (ii) territory size depended on gonadal hormones in both sexes, which was expected for males, but not previously reported in females, (iii) female territory size showed a positive relationship with gonadal size, and (iv) females showed relatively larger territories than males. This study demonstrates seasonal changes in the determinants of territory size and thus contributes to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the behavioral plasticity natural territorial behavior.},

  Abstract                 = { Apteronotus leptorhynchus, a gymnotiform fish, produces highly regular electric organ discharges of 600–1000 Hz. Short-term modulations of the electric organ discharge ("chirps") were elicited by imitating the discharges of neighboring fish. Chirps displayed an increase in frequency of approximately 100 Hz, a duration of about 15 ms, and an absolute amplitude of 0.5–2 mV. Since, similar to natural conditions, chirps summated with the beat caused by interference of the fish's own electric organ discharge and the imitating discharge, the size and shape of the chirp's amplitude envelope varied greatly according to its phase relative to the beat cycle; however, the frequency of the chirp amplitude modulation was always 50–100 Hz. All 21 males examined chirped, but their rate of chirping varied considerably (range 2–59 chirps/30 s; mean 22 chirps/30 s). In contrast, only one out of nine females chirped (mean 0.25 chirps/30 s). The latency between stimulus onset and first chirp was variable and often long (range 1.0–25.0 s; median 3.3 s). We propose that chirps are not a sensory reflex but a communicatory behavior regulated by hypothalamic peptidergic input. },

@article{Huey1991,
abstract = {By determining the microclimates that an animal experiences, habitats influence an animal's physiological capacities and ultimately its demographic and ecological performance. As a result, the ecology of organisms-especially of ectotherms-can be profoundly affected by the physiological consequences of habitat selection. Early ecologists such as Shelford and Chapman appreciated these issues, but most later ones tended to ignore physiology and instead focused on biotic interactions (e.g., competition). Recent technical and conceptual developments are now fostering a reintroduction of physiology into ecology. For issues relevant to thermal physiology, three steps are involved. First, the microclimates available in a habitat must be mapped. For ectotherms, this involves determining the operative environmental temperatures (Te)-that is, the potential body temperatures available in a habitat. Biophysical techniques can now generate Te maps with considerable accuracy. Second, the physiological effects of body temperature must be quantified. This requires laboratory studies of the effect of temperature on key performance traits. Third, the physiological suitability of habitats can be predicted by integrating the above environmental and physiological data. Analyses of the physiological conse- quences of habitat selection are exemplified in several case studies, and the importance of considering food and other factors in the analyses is stressed. An extension to endotherms is briefly discussed},

    abstract = "{Animals across species compete for limited resources. Whereas in some species competition behavior is solely based on the individual's own abilities, other species assess their opponents to facilitate these interactions. Using cues and communication signals, contestants gather information about their opponent, adjust their behavior accordingly, and can thereby avoid high costs of escalating fights. We tracked electrocommunication signals known as ‘rises’ and agonistic behaviors of the gymnotiform electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus in staged competition experiments. A larger body size relative to the opponent was the sole significant predictor for winners. Sex and the frequency of the continuously emitted electric field only mildly influenced competition outcome. In males, correlations of body size and winning were stronger than in females and, especially when losing against females, communication and agonistic interactions were enhanced, suggesting that males are more motivated to compete. Fish that lost competitions emitted the majority of rises, but their quantity depended on the competitors’ relative size and sex. The emission of a rise could be costly since it provoked ritualized biting or chase behaviors by the other fish. Despite winners being accurately predictable based on the number of rises after the initial 25 min, losers continued to emit rises. The number of rises emitted by losers and the duration of chase behaviors depended in similar ways on physical attributes of contestants. Detailed evaluation of these correlations suggests that A. leptorhynchus adjusts its competition behavior according to mutual assessment, where rises could signal a loser's motivation to continue assessment through ritualized fighting.}",
